*** Testing contiguous-internally allocated memory: Serialisation of uniform n-dimensional array

Constructing the output array with re-indexing off took 0.253009
Number of elements in output array is 3000000
Serialisation out with re-indexing off took 3.11637
Number of elements in input array is 3000000
Serialisation in with re-indexing off took 1.74991

The array is smaller in this test because reindexing is on and indexes take up a lot of room - modify this according to available memory

Constructing the output array with re-indexing on took 0.0393045
Number of elements in output array is 300000
Serialisation out with re-indexing on took 0.321851
Number of elements in input array is 300000
Serialisation in with re-indexing on took 0.191275

*** Testing contiguous-internally allocated memory: Serialisation of non-uniform n-dimensional array

Constructing the output array with re-indexing off took 0.258889
Number of elements in output array is 2400645
Serialisation out with re-indexing off took 1.40627
Number of elements in input array is 2400645
Serialisation in with re-indexing off took 1.53132

The array is smaller in this test because reindexing is on and indexes take up a lot of room - modify this according to available memory

This will take a long time because even though the array is smaller, it is non-uniform and the indexes need to be recalculated on-the-fly

Constructing the output array with re-indexing on took 0.0611153
Number of elements in output array is 240645
Serialisation out with re-indexing on took 0.143672
Number of elements in input array is 240645
Serialisation in with re-indexing on took 9.42812
