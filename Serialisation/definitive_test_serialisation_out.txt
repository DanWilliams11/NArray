*** Testing contiguous-internally allocated memory: Serialisation of non-uniform n-dimensional array

Constructing the output array with re-indexing off took 0.858607
Number of elements in output array is 2400645
Serialisation out with re-indexing off took 1.23768
Number of elements in input array is 2400645
Serialisation in with re-indexing off took 2.0982

The array is now smaller because reindexing is on and indexes take up a lot of room - modify this according to available memory

This will take a long time because even though the array is smaller, it is non-uniform and the indexes need to be recalculated on-the-fly
